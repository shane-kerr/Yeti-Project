Introduction
============
The main goal of Yeti DNS Project is to act as an experimental
network. We will conduct experiments using this network. In order to
make the findings that result from these experiments more rigorous, we
use an experiment protocol.

The Protocol
============
A Yeti experiment goes through four phases:

1. Proposal  
   The first step is to make a proposal. This should be sent in an
   e-mail to [yeti discuss mailing list](mailto:discuss@lists.yeti.org). A sample template is
   included below. It is discussed and if accepted by the Yeti
   participants then it can proceed to the next phase.

2. Lab Test  
   The next phase is to run a version of the experiment in a
   controlled environment. The goal is to check for problems such as
   software crashes or protocol errors that may cause failures on the
   Yeti network, before putting onto the experimental network. This is
   not intended to be comprehensive, but rather a simple precaution
   and proof-of-concept. (Note that this may be done before the
   proposal is submitted, but feedback may result in a different
   experimental design, which may mean that the lab test would have to
   be done again.)

3. Yeti Test  
   The next phase actually running the experiment on the Yeti 
   network or some kind of Parallel system in Yeti testbed.
   Details of this will depend on the experiment. It must be
   coordinated with the Yeti participants.

4. Report of Findings  
   When completed, a report of the findings of the experiment should
   be made with a fixed name format like yeti-001 document. It need 
   not be an extensive document. (This may be delayed, for example 
   if the experimenter wishes to publish a paper in a peer-reviewed 
   journal first.)
